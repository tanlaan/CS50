0.  A disease caused by the inhalation of silica dust from a volcano. It used to be the longest word in the English dictionary.
1.  getrusage gets usage statistics for a resource. A volume of information is available.
2.  Sixteen members are within an rusage struct.
3.  To save time and memory as we don't need to copy the value of one struct to another just to do computations.
4.  We initialize data that is required for keeping track of our time, attempt to open a file and error if we can't. Followed by
initializing for our main for loop, we then use the for loop to walk character by character through our file until we hit an EOF,
then we exit, checking for errors in file reads. We check that each character is alphanumeric or an apostraphy. If it is an apostraphy,
it must be after the first letting of the word. 'nt isn't a word, but ain't would be. If we find a digit, we throw out the word
and start over. If however we end up getting to a non alphanumeric character (say a space) we've reached the end of word and increment
certain variables for tracking, then check whether it's misspelled. If it is, print it, otherwise continue on to the end. After we
deinit a our file and print out our statistics.
5.  The problem with using fscanf is there is the possibility of segmentation fault as we don't know how large of a "string" we'd pull out
from our text document. We also can't guarantee it is well formed input. I suppose we could limit the amount of characters coming in
but that still seems like a lesser choice.
6.  We want to make sure no changes occur to the char we are referencing?
