1.  stdint.h is a header file which gives convenient definitions for type sizes based on their name. Very useful for malloc.
2.  the point of using those is to allow for an easy definition for the size of a specific type. You can easily use it to malloc an allotment of memory that is guaranteed to be the correct size for your corresponding size.
3.  BYTE is equal to 8 bits unsigned, DWORD is 32 bits unsigned, LONG is 32 bits signed, and WORD is of size 16 bits unsigned.
4.  The first two bytes of memory for a bitmap must be 'BM'.
5.  bfsize is the size in bytes of the entire file inclusive. bisize however is just the size of the bitmap info header struct size.
6.  If biheight is negative that means the image is top down, and begins at the top left corner.
7.  biBitCount.
8.  If the "infile" doesn't actually exist.
9.  The reason is we are only trying to access one "chunk" of the total file stream. So we pull out a chunk of the file of our set size and only that.
10. In this case, RGB triple should return 3*8 bits (24) multiplied by 3 (72), modulo 4 (0), modulo 4 (4), 4 - 4 (0). So padding should be 0.
11. fseek allows one to move where the current point in the stream we are pointing to by an offset.
12. SEEK_CUR is a shortcut to get the current poing in the stream we are at.
